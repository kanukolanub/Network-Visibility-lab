# 🔍 Network & Host Visibility Lab – Blue Team Fundamentals

As part of my transition into cybersecurity (SOC/Blue Team), I completed a hands-on lab focused on analyzing key network traffic components for early-stage detection.

---

## 🧪 Lab Objective

Build visibility into endpoint and network activity by capturing and analyzing:

- DNS queries & responses
- HTTP GET requests
- TCP 3-way handshakes

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Environment

- 🧠 **Wireshark** – Packet capture and deep inspection
- 💻 Virtual lab using Kali Linux, Windows VM, and simulated traffic

---

## 🧩 Steps Performed

1. Simulated network traffic from Kali to Windows VM (DNS, HTTP)
2. Captured traffic using **Wireshark**
3. Analyzed PCAP files for:
   - `DNS` queries/responses
   - `HTTP GET` requests
   - `TCP SYN/SYN-ACK/ACK` handshake patterns


---

## 📊 Key Observations

- ✅ Clear identification of TCP 3-way handshakes
- ✅ Successful and failed DNS queries (analyzing domains and TTLs)
- ✅ Full capture of HTTP GET requests and headers
- ✅ Host and network logs aligned for end-to-end visibility

---

## 💡 What I Learned

- Network traffic leaves rich forensic trails for defenders
- Understanding normal behavior (like handshake patterns) is critical to spotting anomalies
- Tools like Wireshark are powerful for real-time and retrospective analysis

## 📁 Artifacts

- 📸 Screenshots of Wireshark captures
